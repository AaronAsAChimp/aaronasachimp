# Do side effects prevent tree shaking?

Tree shaking has taken the JavaScript community by storm. In this article we
will look into how side effects affect tree shaking and contribute to larger
bundle sizes.

## How does tree shaking work?

The process can be boiled down to the following steps:

1. For any export that is not used by another module, remove the export keyword.
2. Use normal minification tools to remove the unused code.

## What is a side effect?

Any code that executes at the root of a module is a side effect, unless its a
pure function (but that's a topic for a different article).

```js
import {funk} from 'boogie'; // <--- Not a Side Effect

class GrooveTrain extends Vehicle {} // <--- Not a Side Effect

function getDown() {} // Also not a Side Effect
```


```js
import 'boogie'; // <--- Side Effect only import

const groove = getDown(); // <--- Side Effect

console.log(groove) // <--- Side Effect
```

## How does this affect bundles?

Lets start by looking at a module without side effects. In this module we only
define a class and export it.

```js
// module.js
export class ModuleClass { /* ... */ }


// main.js
import {ModuleClass} from './module.js';
```

When your bundler runs, Webpack 5 in this case, `main.js` will be an empty
file. The `ModuleClass` import is eliminated because it isn't used, our tree
shaking is working as expected.

Now lets add a log message. This is an entirely reasonable thing to do, but lets
take a look at how it affects the output.


```js
// module.js
console.log('Hello World');
export class ModuleClass { /* ... */ }


// main.js
import {ModuleClass} from './module.js';
```

Webpack output:

```js
(()=>{"use strict";console.log("Hello World")})();
```

Ah ha! Our module was included. This is because the bundler must preserve all of
the functionality of the code, so any code that runs at the root level needs to
be included in the bundle. The class definition, however, is still eliminated
because it isn't used.

This doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but lets look at a more realistic
example. Here we are doing something a little bit different, see if you can
guess what the output will be.

```js
// module.js
export class ModuleClass {
	sayCheese() {
		return 'cheese';
	}

	static greet() {
		return 'Hello World';
	}
} 

console.log(ModuleClass.greet());

// main.js
import module from './module.js';
```

Because we are calling the static method from the side effect it now becomes a
side effect itself. Meaning that it and everything it depends on ends up in the
bundle.

Webpack output:

```js
(()=>{"use strict";console.log(class{sayCheese(){return"cheese"}static greet(){return"Hello World"}}.greet())})();
```

This is where things go wrong because in a real world application modules often
have many dependencies and even more transitive dependencies which can get
pulled into the bundle because of one errant side effect.

## Wrapping up

To answer our initial question, yes, side effects limit the effectiveness of
tree shaking. Applications need to have effects, but we should limit these
effects to a single place in the entry point of the application.

If these effects are buried deep in a module it isn't just difficult to debug, it
could actually affect the performance of your application and bloat your
bundles.
